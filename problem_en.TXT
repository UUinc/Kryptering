Encryption
 Create a program that can decrypt a message.
 The message is decrypted using the following algorithm:
 • The first letter is included
 • Each letter included describes the position of the next letter.
 An 'A' means that the next letter is 1 position in front, an 'B' means 2 positions, and so on.
 • When you reach the last letter, it is included and the message is ready.
 Example 1:
 Encrypted text: HAAAAAAAEAAAAJ
 We include the first letter:
 HAAAAAAAEAAAAJ
 H is the 8th letter in the alphabet, so the next letter is 8 positions forward
 HAAAAAAAEAAAAJ
 E is the 5th letter in the alphabet, so the next letter is 5 positions forward
 HAAAAAAAEAAAAJ
 J is the last letter in the string.  The message is over
 Decrypted text: HEJ
 Example 2:
 Encrypted text: TABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSJABCDEFGHIO
 TABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSJABCDEFGHIO
 Decrypted text: TJO
 In your program, the user should write an encrypted message and the program should print it
 decrypted the message.
 Extra:
 Enables your application to encrypt as well.
 Randomly find the letters that are between the letters of the message.
